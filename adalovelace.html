        <h3>Who was Ada?</h3> <!--This is all of my "facts" that I found in my research.--> 
        
        <!--This paragraph is about Ada's childhood and family life.--> 
            <p> <a href="https://findingada.com/shop/a-passion-for-science-stories-of-discovery-and-invention/ada-lovelace-victorian-computing-visionary/">Ada Lovelace</a> <!--This is a very long biography that someone could find A LOT more information from.--> was born in 1815. She was the only child of a volatile poet father and her mother, Annabella, who loved math. Annabella encouraged Ada to learn about math, science, and logic. She noticed Ada's love of mechanics and talent for math from an early age. </p>
        
        <!--This paragraph is about Ada's marriage and how she got in to analytics.--> 
            <p> At 19, Ada married William King, Earl of Lovelace. When she was around 20, Ada's mentor, Mary Sommerville, introduced her to Charles Babbage. Babbage was a professor who had an unfinished plan for a calculator machine. He was considered "strange" just like Ada so they were very good friends. Tey admired each other. Charles called her "The Enchantress of Numbers." </p>
        
        <!-- This paragraph is about Ada's biggest accomplishment, her writings about coding and machines.--> 
            <p> Babbage and Lovelace worked together on making his plan a reality. He asked her to translate an article from an Italian  mathematician. He told her to add comments. Her comments ended up being 3 times as long as the article. She included many ideas for the use of the machine, including making music, and codes to be used. It was published in England as "Sketch of the Analytical Engine, With Notes from the Translator." </p>
        
        <!-- This paragraph is about Ada's death and who she inspired after.--> 
            <p> Ada died of cancer a couple years after this publication. She was only 36. However, her writings were used as the framework for the inventor of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOkmyICUW_c">first modern computer</a><!--This is a video about Ada's contributions to the first modern computer and her life.-->, Alan Turing, in the 1940s. </p>
        
        <section> <!--This is a portrait of Ada that I also used for my favicon. It is also sectioned so that it is centered.--> <img src="adaportrait.jpeg" alt="This is a portrait of Ada." title="This is a portrait of Ada."/> </section>
        
    </main>
    
    <aside id="sidebarB"> <!-- This is about how intregal Ada's life was to our life today. It is to the right of my main information.--> 
        
        <h3>How is Ada's life still affecting us today?</h3>
        
            <p> Without Ada's writings and passion for computing, we would not have the amazing technologies we have today. These include:</p>  
        
            <ul> <!-- This is an unordered list of inventions that parts of Ada's codes were used for.--> 
                <li>computers</li>
                <li>calculators</li>
                <li>cell phones</li>
                <li>AND MANY MORE!</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p> Ada also inspired many of the most famous computer programmers and inventors of the modern world. Including Alan Turing who invented the first modern computer. Ada Lovelace continues to inspire the next generation of women in science and mathematics on "Ada Lovelace Day." This is a celebration of the contributions of women in the technology feild as well as an oppurtunity to thank the women in your life who have inspired you to pursue a career in IT. </p>
